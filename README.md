# Zenthrix Reproducible Edge Benchmark Suite

[![Nightly Benchmarks](https://img.shields.io/badge/benchmarks-nightly-blue)](.github/workflows/nightly-benchmarks.yml)

This repository contains fully automated, deterministic benchmarking scripts comparing **Zenthrix** runtime performance against industry baselines:

- **Apple CoreML Tools** (v0.8+)
- **llama.cpp** (Metal & Hexagon builds)
- **PyTorch ExecuTorch** (v0.3+)

Results are intended for reproducibility and review. Only validated result
files should be published; each result must identify its implementation,
hardware, model, and metric values.

## Primary Metrics Evaluated

1. **Time To First Token (TTFT)** — Milliseconds elapsed before emitting the initial completion token.
2. **Tokens Per Second (TPS)** — Sustained autoregressive generation throughput under fixed sequence lengths (context = 512 tokens, generated = 128 tokens).
3. **Peak Resident Set Size (RSS)** — Physical RAM overhead measured throughout the execution lifecycle.
4. **Thermal Throttling Threshold** — Latency variation across continuous 15-minute inference stress tests.

## Result Format

An example validated result file is available at
[`examples/results.json`](examples/results.json). Validate it with:

```bash
uv run zbench validate examples/results.json
uv run zbench report examples/results.json
```

The result validator accepts `ttft_ms`, `tokens_per_second`, `peak_memory_mb`,
and `load_time_ms`. Values must be finite and positive. Versioned result
envelopes also record an ISO 8601 timestamp, source commit, environment, and
measurement configuration; all results in one file must share the same
hardware and model context.

## Reproducing the Results

### 1. Set Up the Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/withbrian-technologies/zenthrix-benchmarks.git
cd zenthrix-benchmarks
uv sync
```

### 2. Run the Matrix Test

Execute the automated harness across all installed framework runtimes:

```bash
python scripts/run_zenthrix_eval.py --config configs/llama_3.2_1b.yaml --device local
python scripts/run_coreml_eval.py --config configs/llama_3.2_1b.yaml
python scripts/run_llamacpp_eval.sh --model llama-3.2-1b.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

### 3. Generate a Comparative Report

Process the raw telemetry JSONs into visual performance plots:

```bash
python scripts/generate_charts.py --input results/ --output-dir ./charts
```

The `zbench` utility validates result JSON files and renders stable Markdown
summaries:

```

uv run zbench validate results.json
uv run zbench report results.json
```

Report columns are emitted in a stable order, implementations are sorted by
name, and the best value in each metric is bolded. Higher throughput is better;
lower latency, memory, and load time are better. Missing measurements are shown
as `—` rather than being treated as zero.

## Integrity and Hardware Telemetry

All metrics are captured via OS-level tracing utilities (`powermetrics` on macOS; `perf` and `sysfs` on Linux/Android) to avoid runtime measurement distortion. System-level CPU/GPU/NPU core frequencies and thermal zones are logged continuously to verify the absence of thermal throttling during comparative iterations.
